Pet Tracking System (PTS) is a system that can be used for tracking shelter/street animals or pets.

# Issue :red_circle:

In Türkiye, the growing number of **stray and shelter animals** has made it increasingly difficult to maintain accurate and reliable records. This issue affects not only the animals but also veterinarians, shelters, and the general public.

For example, if a dog has not been vaccinated but the system incorrectly indicates otherwise—or if there is no system to verify its vaccination status—serious problems could arise. Consider a scenario where a stray dog bites someone. Without accurate and accessible records, chaos and misinformation could occur, potentially leading to unnecessary panic or legal issues.

# Solution :chains:
A **blockchain-based** system can solve these problems by providing a permanent, tamper-proof record of all processes and events related to an animal. Here’s how it works:

-   Each transaction (e.g., vaccination, medical treatment, adoption) is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring it cannot be altered or deleted.
-   Even if a mistake occurs (e.g., a cat being vaccinated incorrectly), the record will remain visible for transparency.
-   Users can scan a QR code on an animal's earring or collar to access all relevant information, such as vaccination history, medical treatments, and shelter records.

# Extras :handshake:

We will also provide the option for users to take ownership of an animal. Member users can view animals currently living in shelters or with veterinarians. They can send a request for a specific animal and wait (this could take a few minutes or a few days). The system will check the user’s history, financial background, and health status to ensure they meet the requirements. If everything is approved, the user can adopt the animal. This process ensures the safety and well-being of the animals.
